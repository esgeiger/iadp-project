      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p><img class="portrait" src="images/Erik-Geiger-400x400.jpg" alt="Erik wearing a black turtleneck.">I have worked in web development for the University of Madison-Wisconsin's Information Technology department since the 2001. For most of that time I have practiced web accessibility. I resolved to become an expert in web accessibility beginning around 2015, and worked toward that goal steadily, culminating in becoming certified in Internet Accessibility, Design and Policy through the University of Illinois' IADP program in 2023.</p>
      <p>My current position is web operations manager in which capacity I lead the development, implementation and maintenance of the UW-Madison IT department's <a href="https://it.wisc.edu">main website</a>. I lead efforts to ensure website quality, efficiency, and compliance with accessibility, security, privacy, and other university requirements and laws. I also participate in the design of the site and its information architecture.</p>
      <p>I also hold post graduate certifications in Plain Language Communication and in Technical Writing, from the University of Wisconsin and Clemson University, respectively.</p>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy cooking, eating, gaming and hiking with my wife and dogs.
