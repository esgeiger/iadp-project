      <h2>Why accessbility matters</h2>
         <h3>It's the right thing to do</h3>
            <p>The web is meant to provide access to information and opportunity to as many people as possible. It is only right that your website is accessbile to ensure that all can participate.</p>
         <h3>It's good business</h3>
            <p>As many as one in four adults in the United States have some form of disability. Do you really want to exclude one in four potential customers?</p>
         <h3>It's the law</h3>
            <p>If your website is open to the public, it's must comply with the <a href="https://www.ada.gov/resources/web-guidance/">Americans with Disabilities Act</a> and  <a href="https://www.section508.gov/">federal rehabilitation act’s section 508</a>, and web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</p>
